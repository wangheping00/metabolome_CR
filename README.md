# metabolome_CR
The code used for downstream metabolomic data analyses performed in R that was used to produce figures presented in the article.

The analysis includes three parts:
1. Multi-tissue metabolomic analysis of liver, heart, and serum in apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE-/-) mice subjected to 4-week-CR diet. 
2. Serum metabolomic analysis in an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) model induced by angiotensinII (AngII) infusion in ApoE-/- mice after CR diet. 
3. The potential of glycerophospholipid metabolism pathway as a vascular disease risk factor in public human cohorts.
